# School_District_Analysis
## Python Project with City Schools

# Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
This project was to  provide an analysis of standardize testing scores of reading and math for all of the inner city high schools. This analysis was for the purpose of identifying trends within the district by viewing the number of students, the amount of spending per student, the school's overall budgets, and other variables as they relate to student performances by grade within each institution. This analysis will give both a school specific view and a district view of trends affecting testing performances. 

Within this analysis you will be provided a snapshot of the district's key metrics, an overview of each school's key metrics, and this information will consist of the folowing:

  - The top and bottom 5 performing high schools. This will be based on the overall passing rate of the tests
  - Average score of math by grade level and school
  - Average score of reading by grade level and school
  - How performace relates to school budget per student
  - How performance relates to school size
  - How performance relates to type of school (District or Charter)


# Analysis Results:
In this section, we will be discussing the results of our analysis through answering the following questions:

 - How is the district summary affected?
 - How is the school summary affected?
 - How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
 - How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
   - Math and reading scores by grade
   - Scores by school spending
   - Scores by school size
   - Scores by school type

# Summary:
In conclusion to this analysis, some changes occurred after the reading and math scores for the ninth graders at Thomas High School were replaced with NaNs. These four changes occurred as a result of the updated district analysis and are as follows:
